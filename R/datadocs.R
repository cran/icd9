#' @title Quan adaptation of Deyo/Charlson comorbidities
#' @description Derived programmatically from the SAS code used in the original
#'   publication. According to the referenced study, this provides the best
#'   presdictor of in-patient to <30d mortality. Of note, Deyo drops the
#'   distinction between leukemia, lymphoma and non-metastatic cancer. As far as
#'   I have looked into this, in the rare cases where someone had two or three
#'   of leukemia, lymphoma and non-metastatic cancer, the Quan adaptation would
#'   give a lower Charlson score than the original scheme. The Deyo original
#'   Charlson to ICD-9-CM groups does include distinct categories for these
#'   things.

#' @title Elixhauser comorbidities
#' @description The original mapping of Elixhauser's ICD-9-CM to 30
#'   comorbidities. According to Sharabiani et al, this mapping provides the
#'   best long-term mortality prediction. The weaknesses of this mapping are
#'   that it is based on slightly out-dated ICD-9 codes. I have not yet verified
#'   what changes to the ICD-9-CM specification between 1998 and now would
#'   impact this mapping.

#' @title Comorbidity names
#' @description These lists provide correctly sorted names of the comorbidities
#'   and their particular permutations in both full and abbreviated forms.
#'
#'   In the Elixhauser derived mappings, uncomplicated and complicated
#'   hypertension are listed separately, but are always combined in the final
#'   analyses. Uncomplicated and complicated hypertension are list separately
#'   and as "Hypertension, combined." Abbrev suffix indicates a very short
#'   space-free description. Quan's version of Elixhauser is identical. AHRQ's
#'   update drops the arrythmia field. The naming convention is a root, e.g.
#'   \code{elixComorbid}, with neither/either/both suffixes \code{Htn} and
#'   \code{Abbrev}. The Charlson derived mappings do not include hypertension.
#'   Abbreviated comorbidity names are helpful for interactive work, whereas the
#'   full names might be prefered for plotting.
#' @format list, with character/numeric code. 'Hypertension, uncomplicated' and
#'   'Hypertension, complicated' are labelled '6a' and '6b'. Diabetes, cancer,
#'   and metastasis are counted independently, as in the original paper, giving

#' @description These are derived from the CMS published updates, with versions
#'   23 to 32 currently available going back to 2004/5. The source files back to
#'   version 27 have short and long descriptions. The short descriptions are in
#'   ASCII with no special characters, whereas the long descriptions contain
#'   accented characters which seem to be interpretable as unicode, latin-1 or
#'   cp1252. This all done during package creation, but can be repeated by
#'   package users, including pulling the data from the web pages directly.
