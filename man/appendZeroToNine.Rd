\usage{
appendZeroToNine(str)
}
\arguments{
\item{str}{vector of numbers (or character representation of numbers)}
}
\value{
vector of characters with 0 to 9 appended to each input value
}
\description{
appends the characters "0" to "9" to elements of character
  vector Used for extrapolating all the possible ICD9 codes in order to
  match. The alternative approach is the way done in the 'comorbidities'
  package, but this has a load of messy seq() functions in the middle of the
  comorbid groups specification, and as far as I can tell, some errors
  arising from the non-numeric nature of ICD-9 codes. My way allows simple
  specification of, e.g. code "100" and all possible child codes are
  captured. #examples #appendZeroToNine("1") #appendZeroToNine(1:3)
