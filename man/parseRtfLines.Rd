\item{verbose}{single logical value, defaults to \code{FALSE} in most functions.}
}
\value{
named character vector, with names being the ICD-9 codes, and the
  contents being the descriptions from the RTF source. Elsewhere I do this
  the other way around, but the tests are now wired for this layout. "Tidy"
  data would favour having an un-named two-column data frame.
