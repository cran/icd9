\title{Tools for Working with ICD-9 Codes, and Finding Comorbidities}
\description{
Obsolete: 'icd9' is replaced by CRAN package 'icd'.
Calculate comorbidities, Charlson scores, perform fast and accurate
validation, conversion, manipulation, filtering and comparison of ICD-9-CM
(clinical modification) codes. ICD-9 codes appear numeric but leading and
trailing zeroes, and both decimal and non-decimal "short" format codes
exist. The package enables a work flow from raw lists of ICD-9 codes from
hospital billing databases to comorbidities. ICD-9 to comorbidity mappings
from Quan (Deyo and Elixhauser versions), Elixhauser and AHRQ included. Any
other mapping of codes, such as ICD-10, to comorbidities can be used.
}
\details{
\describe{

  \item{Comorbidities}{ \code{\link{icd9Comorbid}} determines co-morbidities
  for a set of patients with one or more ICD-9 codes each.
  \code{\link{icd9Charlson}} calculates Charlson score (Comorbidity Index).

  \itemize{

  \item AHRQ comorbidity mapping is provided, and a function to read the raw
  SAS code from AHRQ into R data structures. The pre-processed data is
  available by lazy-loading in \code{\link{ahrqComorbid}}. AHRQ releases new
  mappings annually.

  \item Quan revised both Deyo/Charlson and Elixhauser ICD-9 to comorbidity
  mappings. These are presented as: \code{link{quanDeyoComorbid}} (which is
  also derived from the original SAS code used in his publication, referenced
  in the data documentation), and \code{\link{quanElixComorbid}} which was
  transcribed directly from the same paper.

  \item The original Elixhauser mapping is provided, with codes transcribed
  from the original publication. See \code{\link{elixComorbid}}.

  } }

  \item{Validation}{\code{\link{icd9IsValid}} checks whether ICD-9 codes are
  syntactically valid (although not necessarily genuine ICD-9 diagnoses). In
  contrast, \code{\link{icd9IsReal}} checks whether ICD-9 codes correspond to
  diagnoses in the current ICD-9-CM definition from CMS.}

  \item{Conversion}{ There are many functions to convert ICD-9 codes or their
  components between different formats and structures. The most commonly used
  are:  \code{\link{icd9DecimalToShort}}, \code{\link{icd9ShortToDecimal}} to
  convert, e.g., 002.3 to 0023 and back again. See \link{convert} for other
  options.}

  \item{Manipulation}{You can find children of a higher-level ICD-9 code with
  \code{\link{icd9Children}} and find a common parent to a set of children
  (or arbitrary list of ICD-9 codes) with \code{\link{icd9Condense}}.
  \code{\link{icd9Sort}} sorts in hierarchical, then numerical order, so
  100.0 comes before 100.00, for example. \code{\link{icd9WideToLong}} and
  \code{\link{icd9LongToWide}} convert the two most common data structures
  containing patient disease data. This is more sophisticated than standard R
  or Hadleyverse reshaping.}

  \item{Explanation, or decoding}{Use \code{\link{icd9Explain}} to convert a
  list of codes into human-readable descriptions. This function can
  optionally reduce the codes to a their top-level groups if all the child
  members of a group are present. \code{\link{icd9DiffComorbid}} allows
  summary of the differences between comorbidity mappings, e.g. to find what
  has changed from year-to-year or between revisions by different authors.
  \code{\link{icd9Hierarchy}} is a \code{data.frame} containing the full
  ICD-9 classification for each diagnosis. \code{\link{icd9Chapters}}
  contains definitions of chapters, sub-chapters and three-digit groups.}
