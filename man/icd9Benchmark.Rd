icd9Benchmark()

\description{
\code{icd9} package is intended to be used with large data sets, with
millions or rows. Performance of core functions is therefore of some
importance, after correctness. R package test code is for correctness,
whereas this script stresses the core functions, and looks for bottlenecks.
