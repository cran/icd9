\description{
This runs quite slowly. Used too rarely to be worth optimizing
  now. This is used to build a master list of ICD-9 codes with their
  respective chapters, sub-chapters, etc.. The querying of the web page to
  get these is already done, and the results saved in the lists
  \code{icd9Chapters} etc which define ranges.
