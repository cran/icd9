\item{year}{from 1996 to 2012 (this is what CDC has published). Only 2012

\description{
Currently only the most recent update is implemented. Note that
  CMS have published additional ICD-9-CM billable code lists since the last
  one from the CDC: I think these have been the same every year since 2011,
  though. THe last CDC release is Dtab12.rtf from 2011.
