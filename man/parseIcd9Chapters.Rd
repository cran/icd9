parseIcd9Chapters(year = NULL, save = FALSE)
}
\description{
This is rather slow, queries a web page repeatedly, which is
  both non-reproducible, and perhaps bad form. Aim to deprecate and replace
  with my own RTF parsing of canonical documents, which is now working
  reasonably well, at least for 'major' codes from 2015.

\details{
This is not almost obsolete. The only remaining use is the chapter
  and sub-chapter names and ranges, or validation.
